torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 24.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.69 GiB of which 21.36 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 2.32 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 1.62 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 404.62 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
